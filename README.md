Template for Go based on the [View First](https://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/liftweb/View_First) approach the Lift Scala web framework takes

##How to use

You can see an example application by going into the `example` folder and then run:

`go run main.go`

then you can go to `http://127.0.0.1:7070/index`

and you will see a simple page displaying the current time, if you refresh the page, the time will update.

**This is really early alpha, but it works!**
